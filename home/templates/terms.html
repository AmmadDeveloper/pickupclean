            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>8.4.1</strong>Checking Items<br/>
                    Please ensure to thoroughly check all the garments for hazardous items e.g. coins, pens, keys, etc. as we hold no responsibility for any items lost or damaged as a result of the cleaning process.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>8.4.2</strong>Washing and Drying Process<br/>
                    The load is washed at a 30 degree cycle and tumble dried at a medium heat. As we process a high volume we might not always be able to cater to personal requirements (e.g. temperature, washing powders, etc.). Please note that the items are not ironed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>8.4.3</strong>Color Separation<br/>
                    We will separate the clothes into lights and darks for you. Although we will take the utmost care in doing this, we will accept no responsibility if there is any bleeding or color transfer during the cleaning process.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>8.4.4</strong>Damaged Items<br/>
                    We will not be liable for damage to items, as we wash by the load and do not inspect the care labels of each garment. For garments that need to be specially treated i.e. leather, silk, cashmere, fur, velvet and other delicate garments, please ensure that these items can be machine washed and tumble dried.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>8.4.5</strong>Checking Items<br/>
                    Laundry items are tagged by the load and not individually tagged. Therefore, we cannot accept any liability for missing items.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <ul class="list-disc">
      <li>
        <strong>10.1</strong> The price of the Services will be set out in Our price list as set out in the App or at www.Picupclean.com/prices and will be the price in force at the time you place your Order. Our prices may change at any time, but price changes will not affect Orders that We have accepted in accordance with paragraph 3.2 or 4.3

We will take payment from the debit or credit card, details of which were supplied with your Order. If for any reason we are unable to take payment, you will become liable to Us for the sum due plus interest at the rate 3% a year above the base lending rate of Barclays Bank PLC from the time to time. Interest will accrue on a daily basis from due date until the date of actual payment of the overdue amount, whether before or after judgment.
